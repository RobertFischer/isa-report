		<h1 id="paying-attention">This All Started When I Was Barely Paying Attention</h1>

		<p class="lead">
		Once upon a time, I was at a big dinner put on by my financial advisor's firm. Everyone they worked with was invited,
		and they had someone from American Funds come in to pitch us. I don't remember
		much about who that person was or what was said, but I remember this chart.</p>

		<blockquote class="twitter-tweet mx-auto" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Investing in index funds? See how 5 U.S.-focused American Funds have fared better since index funds launched. <a href="https://t.co/pyrx0M3wAI">https://t.co/pyrx0M3wAI</a></p>&mdash; American FundsÂ® (@AmericanFunds) <a href="https://twitter.com/AmericanFunds/status/860888140864552960?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 6, 2017</a></blockquote>

		<p>Of course, I was supposed to be taking from it that American Funds are awesome. And they certainly did well here, and the chart makes
		their point well. But what really got me is this: you put $10k in an investment&mdash;even a boring, bad long-term investment like an
		index fund&mdash;and you can turn it into a 70x return.  The American Mutual Fund, which is based on preservation of
		principal, still beat that and got you an 87x return. If you stuck with a mutual fund that targeted exclusively growth
		(<abbr class="initialism">AMCAP</abbr>),
		you saw a 200x return (you also saw some terrifying dips, but it paid off in the end). Those are some big multipliers, despite
		wading through some pretty ugly times.	So how did these numbers get so big?</p>

		<p>The real power of this wasn't the financial products themselves. That's not how you win. The financial products just determine
		how <em>much</em> you win. You win with the time-value of money: the combination of $10k and 40 years is the winning combination.
		Money through time allows you to tap the power of compound earnings. <strong>Money over time is exponential.</strong></p>

		<p>If you need to see that in practice, check the chart again: the funds that did the best were the ones that
		gained the most on the upswings. Even though they suffered worse on the downticks, they still were ahead...and when the next
		upswing happened, they had a head start which allowed them to pull even farther ahead. The more conservative funds couldn't
		catch up, and so they had to settle for mere 70x returns instead of 200x returns.</p>

		<h1 id="regret">My Immediate Regret</h1>

		<p class="lead">"Wow," I thought to myself,
		<strong>"I wish I had been forced put $10k away when I had 40 years before my retirement."</strong>
		I wasn't making very much at that point: I was working data entry for a sketchy and semi-predatory car loan place, so it
		didn't pay much, but I was living with my folks and eating their food and begging for gas money off them. I could have
		stashed away $10k over the course of a couple of years. If I had done that, simply by hiding that money away and ignoring it,
		I could be retiring with a lot of cash on hand no matter what else happened in the meantime. That'd be nice.</p>

		<p>I was thinking about this and about how youth is wasted on the young, and that's the point when I realized:
		I <em>was</em> forced to put money away before retirement. Specifically, that big
		<abbr class="initialism">FICA</abbr> bite that came out of every paycheck added up to $10k pretty fast. If you make
		$40k/year, you're contributing $10k in FICA every 4 years. If you make $20k/year (roughly $10/hr), you're contributing
		$10k in <abbr class="initialism">FICA</abbr> every 8 years. <b>If you put in 4 years at $40k or 8 years at $20k
		before your 30th birthday, you have putting enough into social security to have earned $2,000,000 in the bank when you
		retire at 70.</b> And that's if you never made another penny for your entire life. Two million.</p>

		<h2 id="contribution-chart">We Value Your Contributions</h2>

		<p class="lead">So just how much are you putting into social security? The tax that goes to social security is called
		<abbr class="initialism" title="Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance">OASDI</abbr>, and
		<a href="https://www.ssa.gov/oact/progdata/taxRates.html">the Social Security Administration has historical rates</a>.
		The short answer is that since 1990, 6.2% of your paycheck is taxed for social security. We'll start our calculation from
		1990 simplicity's sake. Given that number and some ballpark values about income history, here's how much you've contributed,
		and how much your social security contributions would be worth if you invested them in 30-Year T-Bonds (the safest investment
		possible&mdash;basically, how much the money is worth to the government), high-yield bonds (a riskier but more profitable
		investment), and <a href="https://www.daveramsey.com/blog/the-12-reality">the 12% return rule</a>.</p>

		<p>Maybe you have been doing a better job than me saving for retirement, but my retirement funds
		aren't anything like the value of the money that I have contributed to the social security fund.
		Seeing those value curves going up makes me really wish that I had that kind of money at my disposal.
		But, the government's got that money, and they'll give me money when I get to my retirement age.
		So maybe I'm not missing out...? At this point, I went looking for what my social security payout
		can expect to be.</p>

		<h2 id="social-security-payout">The Payout</h2>

		<p>Right up front, let me say that I am ignoring the ugliness. As of this writing, the Social Security
		Trust Fund (which pays the social security benefits) is in a bad way, because Baby Boomers are drawing
		from it
		much faster than Millenials are refilling it. This was a predictable problem, and the trust fund had
		stashed away some surplus, but it is looking like we did not stash away enough: since 2010, we've been
		draining the account; in 2022, overall cost is expected to exceed total income for the fund; in 2034, the
		fund is completely depleted.
		(<a href="https://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TRSUM/index.html">See the Trustee's Report Summary, search for
			"Key Dates for the Trust Funds".</a>) The worst part is that it's not like we are being caught
		off-guard&mdash;every year since 1990, the Trustee's Report has predicted the fund being depleted
		between 2029 and 2043. (See
		<a href="https://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/2017/VI_B_LRact_bal.html#103557">Table VI.B1</a>.)
		Once the fund is depleted, Social Security is expected to only be able to pay 70% of its
		obligations.</p>

		<p>But let's ignore that. Let's pretend that social security is bailed out by the general fund, or some
		other miracle occurs, and that social security benefits for people retiring in the future remain
		consistent with what they are now. What would today's workers expect to receive?</p>

		<p class="lead">
		There's a lot of complexity in calculating exactly what your benefits are, having to do with the amount
		of your income, your years working, your family situation, and your retirement age. However, there is one
		simple constant that cuts through all of this: the maximum benefit. <strong>You will not receive more than
		$2,150/mo from Social Security retirement. Period. Full stop.</strong> So if you are banking on Social
		Security, you are maxing out your retirement lifestyle at $25k/year, and you are only going to get that if
		you made $128k or more for a decade or so.	(Oh, and did I mention the money you get back is taxable as
		income?)
		</p>

		<p>At this point, let's take a look at our chart again. Let's extrapolate out using average returns on
		investments and our pattern of raises, and see what kind of retirement that implies for us. We'll figure
		that we work for 40 years and drop all our social security contributions into 12% Rule investments. Then
		we will retire for 60 years without making another penny. Since we don't want a stock exchange collapse or
		a recession to ruin our retirmeent, we'll move all our investments into Treasury Bonds (T-Bonds): T-Bonds
		are both safer and have a slightly better return on investment than storing the cash under our bed.
		During our retirement, we'll take half our interest and cash it out, and we'll save the other half, and
		we'll withdraw our principal evenly. This is all extremely conservative. How does
		that compare to Social Security's maximum payout?</p>

		<p>Behold the power of compound interest! You will probably end up dying with money in
		the bank, earning nontrivial amounts of interest. This is an account that you can leave
		to your children. It's intergenerational wealth, which is a stark contrast to the way
		social security works: if you die after 62 or with adult children, the contributions
		just vanish. There's no more value to you or your children. It's just a tax you paid
		and now the money's gone.</p>

		<p class="lead">All of this makes a pretty compelling case that, at least when it comes to ensuring
		a comfortable retirement for our citizens, the existing Social Security system should be
		replaced with an investment account.	It's just hard to argue with the numbers
		and the power of compound interest.</p>


		<h1 id="is-that-the-point">What's The Point?</h1>

		<p>Okay, so our existing Social Security structure is a really bad investment
		vehicle, and we (and our children) would be much better off if we took that
		money and invested it responsibly ourselves. "But," Clever
		Interlocutor says, "That's not the point! It's effectively a socialized insurance
		policy for death and disability, along with old age. When one of those things happens,
		Social Security ensures that you aren't entirely destitute." This is a totally fair
		point, Clever Interlocutor. Thanks for bringing it up.</p>

		<p class="lead">I would be a poor Christian indeed if I wanted to
		take away support from widows and orphans. But this is where you need to know an
		important truth, which every employer is acutely aware of but which many employees
		don't know: the <abbr class="initialism">FICA</abbr> payments you see coming out of
		your paycheck are literally only half the story. The government also taxes your
		employer at 6.2% of your income. This is beyond the 6.2% they already required your
		employer to take out of your paycheck, for a total of 12.4%.</p>

		<p>So this means that there's a second pool of time-value: the first is the time-value
		of your contributions, amounting to 6.2% of your income; the second is a matching pool
		with just as much value contributed by your employer. This means that literally every
		worker could have a matching non-worker who they supported. That person could have an
		identical retirement even though they never worked a day in their life. It would be
		entirely possible for Social Security to just pair people up at birth, one from a low
		socioeconomic setting and one from a high socioeconomic setting, and then have the
		two of them have the exact same benefits throughout their life. It'd be like
		<em>The Prince and the Pauper, Retirement Edition</em>. Although that is an interesting
		concept for a story, it's a pretty ham-fisted way to go about things. For the moment,
		it suffices to note that there is a pool of money available to address these issues
		which is equal in value to the pool of money that people have generated for their own
		retirement.</p>

		<h2 id="do-not-get-greedy">Don't Get Greedy</h2>

		<p>"I will let that slide for the moment," Clever Interlocutor interjects, "But caring
		for others is only part of the issue. People routinely lose their financial security when
		economic crashes happen, such as the Enron implosion or the Great Recession in the 2000s.
		Even when we are talking about the individual, Social Security provides a kind of guarantee
		of a baseline income in retirement, which stock investment portfolios simply cannot do."</p>

		<p>Again, you're right, Clever Interlocutor. So there are some important caveats that we need
		to note. A total stock market collapse would indeed
		wipe out a lot of financial products, including high-yield bond and stock investments. There
		are a whole world of even riskier investments that people are often sold, and there is the
		unfortunate fact that investors&mdash;especially amateurs who consider themselves
		well-informed&mdash;tend to think they are leading trends when really they are following them,
		which is a very risky and expensive behavior for an investor.
		(The excellent book, <em>Nudge</em>, covers this is detail.)</p>

		<p class="lead">The purpose of Social Security is not to make you rich in retirement or build
		intergenerational
		wealth. (Although it's awesome if it can do that, too.) The purpose of Social Security is to
		ensure that you are capable of retiring, and to do so without becoming destitute. So any kind of
		Social Security account would need to have a lot more constraints on it than a voluntary retirement
		account. We saw this in our scenario in the conservative behavior: withdrawing only a small amount
		of our principal at a time, reinvesting half our interest, and putting our money into T-Bonds.
		Without those kind of regulations being in place, an individual account is not serving one of the
		key purposes that Social Security is there to serve.</p>

		<h3 id="prodigious-daughter">The Prodigious Daughter</h3>

		<p>In case the graphs above have not made the power of compound interest really obvious,
		let me tell you the Parable of the Prodigious Daughter. There was a family that had two twin children,
		a daughter and a son. The daughter scrimped and saved early on in her life and put away $15,000
		in 12% Rule investments. She then went to work with impoverished and homeless
		communities, which meant she didn't have any more money to save up. Her brother, on the other
		hand, began contributing to his retirement only after his sister did. He also didn't "go nuts"
		like she did, instead contributing $1000 a year for the next 39 years. He copied is sister's
		investments identically. When it came time to retire, he had contributed $39,000 and had
		almost $700,000 to retire on. Not too shabby! But she had only contributed $15,000&mdash;that's
		less than half of what he had contributed&mdash;yet retired with more than twice the cash her
		brother did. One year makes that much difference when compound interest is in play.</p>

		<p>This power of compound interest is the secret to the account-based Social Security alternative.
		It's why this approach will stay effectively solvent while the existing Social Security system is
		failing. This power, however, needs to be protected. There's going to be a tendency for people to
		want to get at their money. That's a reasonable desire, and I get it.  Yet for an account-based
		Social Security alternative to work, the
		first key regulation must protect the time-value of worker's contributions by preventing
		account-holders from withdrawing money
		too soon. They need to be like the daughter, not like the son, becuase the contributions alone
		aren't enough to provide for retirement. This isn't a hypothetical fact, this is a demonstrated
		fact: sacrificing the time-value of money is exactly the reason
		the current Social Security system has failed.</p>

		<p>The current Social Security system is based on the
		current workers paying taxes which directly pay for the benefits to retirees, based on the promise
		that when the current workers retire, the new breed of current worker will support them. But this
		system only works if the workforce and its income keeps growing faster than the people dependent
		upon it. The problems with this approach are identical to a
		<a href="http://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/ponzischeme.asp">Ponzi Scheme</a>, which is not an
		accident. An account-based Social Security alternative avoids the existing Ponzi scheme problems,
		but it can only work if workers are forced to leave their money in the accounts. Otherwise, the
		power of compound interest is lost, we are dependent on the contributions alone, and that's just
		not going to work.</p>

		<p>(BTW, if anyone ever says that Social Security is a Ponzi Scheme, please correct them: Ponzi
		Schemes promise high rates of return.)</p>

		<h3 id="role-of-risk">The Role of Risk</h3>

		<p class="lead">So far, I've been assuming a lot about return on investments for the sake of simplicity. But
		there is a nasty devil in the details, and it has to do with risk. It's an assumed truth that
		the stock market will always go up given a long enough period of time, and
		<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/06/27/what-warren-buffett-learned-from-buying-his-first-stock-at-age-11.html">that
		assumed truth is the key to Warren Buffett's wealth</a> (among others), so it seems safe for us to
		depend on it. Given enough time, you'll always win if you play the markets broadly.
		The problem is what happens when you run out of time.</p>

		<p>Between October 9th, 2007, and March 9th, 2009, the NASDAQ, S&amp;P 500, and Dow Jones all lost
		55% or more of their value
		(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_bear_market_of_2007%E2%80%9309#Index_levels">cite</a>).
		Given that the stock market does always go up given enough time, this translates into a firesale for
		those with time to wait, but does that lost value hamstring their ability to grow? And how does this
		impact people without time to grow? This sounds like we need another chart.</p>

		<p>In the following chart, we have two people who make the same amount of money (the median US income, $40k),
		and they have both put all their money into the market at 12% Return Rule investments, but they get hit with
		a 55% market downturn at some point in their 40 year contributing career. The chart below shows how being
		hit at different times (or not at all) impacts the money available at the end of the career.</p>

		<p>Taking a major hit from a market downturn is clearly painful no matter when it happens, but
		it is especially painful as you get closer to retirement: the amazing power of compound interest
		is foiled by a huge market downturn without time for the compound interest build up again. Good
		mutual funds&mdash;especially those that emphasize "preservation of principal"&mdash;already
		understand how to protect against market downturns, and they do so by using government bonds
		(and other low-risk bonds) as a hedge. We actually already used this approach (in an extreme way)
		in our retirement calculator: we shifted all our investments into Treasury Bonds at retirement.
		A Treasury Bill (aka: T-Bill) is basically a contract with the US Treasury where you give them
		your money for a certain number of years, and they give you a percentage return on that interest.</p>

		<p>It would take the effective collapse of the US government for T-Bonds to lose
		their value, so they are the ultimate insurance policy for US investors. They are also the lowest
		possible risk investment, and therefore the lowest possible return investment. Although you do
		make some interest off T-Bonds, you are missing out on the potential of making a lot more.
		But if the purpose of Social Security is to ensure that people are able to retire and not be
		destitute, then T-Bonds are exactly a product we can use to get there, and the accounts should
		be required to carry an appropriate amount of T-Bonds as investments to mitigate risk, even if
		that limits our returns. That's the cost of security.</p>

		<p class="lead">The conventional wisdom is that you should have some multiple of your age in bonds, with that
		multiple being somewhere between 0.5 and 2.5. The higher that multiple, the more you carry in bonds,
		and the less overall return you would expect to see in the long run. However, the higher that
		multiple, the more you carry in bonds, and the less you will expect to lose in short-term market
		downturns.</p>

		<p>To see this balancing act in action, let's take a look at Alice and Bob again, but this time
		assuming they start work at 20 years old, retire at 60 years old, carry T-Bonds equal to their
		age in percent. Since they hit their market downturns at different ages, the impact of this
		insurance will be be markedly different on their account balance.</p>

		<p class="lead">Well, I'll be a monkey's uncle. It never works to your advantage to carry insurance with a mere
		55% market downturn (ie: the Great Recession). But we know that it can get worse than that. So let's take
		a look at the worst downturn in US history: the crash of 1929. This is the Big Baddy, the one that started
		the Great Depression. It was a 82% downturn
		(<a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/historys-worst-bear-markets-2014-7">cite</a>), so let's take
		a look at that.</p>

		<div id="horrid-hit-canvas" style="width: 100%; height: 50vh"></div>

		<p class="lead">Wow. Even in this worst-case-in-history example, people hit early on in their investment
		careers are better off without the insurance that bonds provide. In fact, the bond insurance
		hurts you more than it helps until are well over halfway through your investment career, and
		that help isn't significant at all until you get to the last 5 to 10 years. Even then, the
		help is not very significant: it protects about 20% of your principal in the case of a second
		Great Depression hitting. As we saw above, anything less was pure downside with no upside.</p>

		<p>Now, these models aren't realistic: they treat the hit as a one-time thing, and
		immediately resume 12% Rule levels of returns. Truly severe economic downturns take
		years to recover and don't have those levels of return in the meantime. However, they
		make the point that the damage done by low returns is worse than the damage done by
		economic downturns, assuming you have time to wait for the recovery and are playing the market
		as a whole.</p>

		<p>Before we get too excited about dumping our bonds, there are three important
		caveats that we need to remember.</p>

		<p>It's important to remember that some people have zero time to wait: those who
		are in retirement cannot afford a 55% or 82% loss on their principal, because they
		are living off of it. So T-Bonds are the perfect investment vehicle for those folks,
		because preservation of principal&mdash;that is, not losing any money&mdash;is the
		most important thing.</p>

		<p>Second, it's important to remember that the guaranteed recovery comes from playing the
		market as a whole, not individual stocks or even sectors. It's entirely possible to lose
		everything in stocks, such as with folks working at Enron who invested in company stock.
		</p>

		<p>Finally, it's important to remember that Social Security is not primarily an investment
		vehicle. Social Security is a social safety net: it's the last resort to ensure that we
		do not have people left destitute because they cannot work due to age or disability, or
		because their spouse or parent died. So although an overall insurance policy may not make
		sense, we also cannot allow a market collapse to leave folks destitute. There must be a
		financial foundation and lifestyle floor provided by Social Security.</p>

		<h2 id="the-rest-of-the-money">But What About the Rest of the Money?</h2>

		<p>I mentioned above that there's a matching 6.2% Social Security tax required from employers,
		and that this creates a pool of money which can be used to supplement others. Just how much
		are we talking, though, and how much of a difference can that make?</p>

		<p>Let's start by looking at the breakdown of income by percentile, so we can get a sense of
		just how much we're talking when we talk about the available income.</p>

		<div id="income-percentiles-canvas" style="width: 100%; height: 50vh"></div>

		<p>Okay, so there's our hockey stick of earnings. But how does that translate into the amount of money
		available? That's a simple matter of math, so here's the graph.</p>

		<div id="contribution-percentiles-canvas" style="width: 100%; height: 50vh"></div>

		<p>It's amazing how big numbers multiply and get even bigger really fast. There are
		<code>167,736,100</code> working Americans. That means there are <code>167,736</code> working
		Americans per percentile. If their employers pay in <code>6.2%</code> of their income, that's
		a lot. It's <code>$31,282,111,706</code> in 2016 for the top percentile alone. That's
		<code>$96</code> for every adult American.</p>

		<p>BTW, if you're curious about proportions of contributions, here those are by quintile.</p>

		<div id="contribution-quintiles-canvas" style="width: 100%; height: 50vh"></div>

		<p>So, my thinking is that everyone should help everyone below them. Let's take that money
		from the employers match and split it among the accounts of everyone in a lower percentile.
		If we do that, here's what the breakdown benefits looks like.</p>

		<div id="sharedown-canvas" style="width: 100%; height: 50vh"></div>

		<p>Yikes. That doesn't look like much. Let's consider the case of someone who makes
		literally no money.  This would be a stay-at-home parent or extremely disabled individual,
		for instance, so it's an important group to consider. Their account only gets $1900/year.
		What does that look like in terms of saving for retirement?</p>

		<div id="sharedown-nowork-canvas" style="width: 100%; height: 50vh"></div>

		<p class="lead">Folks who never work a day in their life (for whatever reason) retire
		at over $40k a year.  Not too shabby, and definitely better than the existing social
		security system. All of this is based on only $1900/year contributed over 40
		years&mdash;if you're not getting the point yet, compound interest truly is amazing.
		More importantly, this could be our new absolute basement for lifestyle in
		retirement in the United States. If you survive to retirement age, even without
		making a dime, you "retire" to a comfortable life and even have a little disposable
		income.</p>

		<p>We have one last group to consider, and that is the severely disabled. The existing
		social security system provides support for those who have disabilities severe enough to
		completely prevent them from working.  For these folks, however, a contribution of
		$1900/year isn't going to keep them alive, much less provide for their long-term
		security. We will return to these individuals and how we can financially provide
		for them once we get a bit farther down the road. But we need to keep them in
		mind.</p>

		<h2 id="putting-it-together">Putting It Together</h2>

		<p>We have all the pieces that we need to put together a sane alternative to our existing
		Social Security system. But, before we do, let's revisit the question: Why do we bother?
		I mean, the existing social security system is astoundingly bad at managing our money, but
		bureaucratic incompetence isn't the main reason it needs to be replaced. <strong>Financial
		security in our society is found in wealth: money in the bank that generates interest is
		true financial security, while an entitlement payout keeps people destitute, demoralized, and
		dependent.</strong> We want a society where people are financially fit, and we clearly need
		a universal mandate for some baseline savings in order to get there.</p>

		<p class="lead">After digging through all this, here is what seems to make sense.</p>

		<h3 id="contributing">Contributing</h3>

		<p>First, we need to get money out of the existing social security system and into our
		investment-based system.</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Each individual gets an Individual Security Account within the SSA. The accounts may
				be transferred from the IRS into banks, at which point they have reporting and management
				requirements akin to Health Savings Accounts.</li>
			<li>We replace social security payroll contributions (payroll FICA tax) with mandatory
				contributions into the worker's Individual Security Account.</li>
			<li>The first $35k paid from of the employer portion of the was-FICA tax now goes into the
				worker's Individual Security Account. This helps get the compounding of interest off to
				a good start, and more than compensates for the loss of the current social security system
				payouts.</li>
			<li>The remaining money from the employer portion of the was-FICA tax now goes into a new
				system, which we'll call the Sharedown System, and which we will get to in a minute.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>Now that we have money on hand, we can invest it.</p>

		<h3 id="investing">Investing</h3>

		<p>How do we invest this money?  On the one hand, this account is our society's baseline account, and
		we don't want to mess with it much. On the other hand, we saw above that time provides its own insurance
		policy against risk. It's also important to notice that we also want to keep things simple and
		straightforward to minimize the opportunities for corruption or abuse, as well as minimizing the amount
		of work the government has to do. Here's how to balance that out.</p>

		<ul>
			<li>If you have less than $100k in your account or your account is with the SSA, it must be invested
				with 10% in T-Bills (short-term), 30% in T-Notes (medium-term), and 40% in T-Bills (long-term). You
				can invest the last 20% in whatever security you want; if your account is with the SSA, they will
				put it in the highest-yield T-Bills that are available. Folks with this little in their account
				just aren't in a place to be playing the investing game, and we don't want the government to be
				in the business of doing wealth management: the private sector does wealth management just fine,
				so let's let the private sector handle it.
			</li>
			<li>Once you clear that threshold and move your money into some private financial institution, you are
				clear to invest more freely as long as you are not withdrawing. The only requirement is that you must
				maintain 2% of your account with one-year liquidity, and 3% with two-year liquidity, and 5% with
				10-year liquidity: we'll get into why later on. (For the record, "2% of your account with
				one-year liquidity" means that if the gov't shows up and demands 2% of the value of your account
				in cash no later than one year from today, you need to be able to provide that cash by that
				deadline.)
			</li>
			<li>If your account loses value and falls under the $100k threshold in value, you have one year
				to get it back up above $100k in value or convert it to the required 80% in bonds.
			</li>
			<li>Your account must be diversified: no more than 5% of the account can be in any single
				stock, future, or corporate bond, and no more than 20% of the account can be in any single
				financial product. This includes T-Notes and T-Bills, so you have to diversify based on term
				even if you invest entirely with the US Treasury.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3 id="sharing">Sharing</h3>

		<p class="lead">Social Security is there in part so that we can have a baseline level of wealth in
		our society.  We want to make sure those who are disabled or destitute have a financial platform
		from which they can continue to thrive, while continuing to reward the drive to industry that
		characterizes the American spirit and makes America such an incredible economic and cultural
		powerhouse.</p>

		<p>To that end, there are two kinds of sharing: <strong>Social Sharing</strong> and
		<strong>Familial Sharing</strong>. The purpose of Social Sharing is to ensure that baseline
		level of prosperity throughout our society. The purpose of Familial Sharing is to ensure that all
		members of a family unit benefit from the family's collective labor, and to help realize the
		American dream of giving our children a better life than we had.</p>

		<p>There's an important concept that we introduce when it comes to sharing: the
		<strong>Contribution Percentile</strong>. Your contribution percentile is the sum of your
		mandatory contributions into your Individual Security Account, multiplied by some
		coefficient (representing the conversion of your income into a "household income" number,
		along with some a need for social support as necessary), and then calcuated as a percentile
		within the US population. The multiplier is detailed in
		<a href="#fiddling-details">Fiddling Details</a> below.</p>

		<p>Here are the two kinds of sharing that people participate in:</p>

		<div class="container">
				<dt class="col-sm-4 col-md-3 col-xl-2">Social Sharing</dt>
				<dd class="col-sm-8 col-md-9 col-xl-10">
					<ul>
						<li>Funded by the employer match for the employee contribution.</li>
						<li>Collected and pooled by the SSA and paid out on January 1st of the
							following full calendar year after collection, so money collected in 2018
							would be paid back out on January 1st, 2020.</li>
						<li>The first $35k paid by employers on an employee's behalf goes back into
							that employee's Individual Security Account. This $35k amount is calculated
							as the lifetime amount conributed by employers on an employee's behalf. The
							goal is to support low-income folks and jumpstart compound interest for
							everyone.</li>
						<li>Any additional money beyond the $35k threshold is pooled by the SSA by
							the contributor's Contribution Percentile. It is split evenly among every
							Individual Savings Account whose Contribution Percentile is less than the
							contributor's Contribution Percentile.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</dd>

				<dt class="col-sm-4 col-md-3 col-xl-2">Familial Sharing</dt>
				<dd class="col-sm-8 col-md-9 col-xl-10">
					<ul>
						<li>Funded by a tax paid into the SSA equivalent to 1% of the value of the account
							at the end of the calendar year.</li>
						<li>Only paid by people who contributed to their account during that calendar
							year.</li>
						<li>Collected by the SSA and paid out on January 1st of the following
							full calendar year after collection, so money collected in 2018 would be based
							on the value at the end of 2017, and would be paid on January 1st, 2020.</li>
						<li>The money collected from a contributor is split evenly among the contributor's
							spouse, dependents, biological children, and adoptive children. These relationships
							are calculated as of the same time the valuation of the account was done for the
							tax calculation.</li>
					</ul>
				</dd>

			
		</div>

		<p>That familial sharing may seem a bit odd, but it has two purposes.</p>

		<p>The less important purpose is to stabilize the accounts between spouses, especially ensuring that
		non-working spouses are getting some pittance into their own accounts. We especially want to
		support people who leave the commercial workforce to raise children. Given divorce rates, gender
		inequality in pay, and the like, this minor levelling is necessary.</p>

		<p>While that is a nice side benefit, the primary purpose of familial sharing is
		to get children benefitting from compound interest starting from infancy, because time is the
		primary value that we are capitalizing on. Just in case the power of compound interest has stopped
		impressing you, here's another interactive chart to play with. It shows the benefits of
		just the parent's contributions to a child's account until the child reaches retirement age.</p>

		<p class="lead">Keep in mind the chart above assumes that the child
		<strong>has a sibling</strong> and
		<strong>never contributes</strong> to their own account.
		This is notably also not including any sharedown.
		The investments are also conservative: it's 30 Year T-Bills until 18,
		12% return from 18 until 50, and then back to the T-Bills
		until 65.</p>

		<h3 id="withdrawing">Withdrawing</h3>

		<p>So now we see how the money gets into the accounts. Since the money is in an individual account, we are not terribly
		picky about how people withdraw it: we don't need the level of oversight and concern that the existing Social Security system
		has. However, we do want to institute some rules, because we don't want a 20 year old to empty their account and then
		end up starving at 30.</p>

		<p>The first way we will control that is by setting a limit on how much can be withdrawn. Since the purpose of these accounts
		is to generate lasting, intergenerational wealth, we want to ensure that the account has money in it at the end, and it is okay
		if a bit is left over when the account holder dies. Therefore, we set the terminal date of the account at 125 years after the
		holder's birth. The amount you can withdraw is such that the current account balance is evenly split between now and that
		terminal date. These withdrawls can be made weekly. You have two options for how to calculate the amount you can
		withdraw each week.</p>

		<dl>
			<dt>(current account balance)/(125*52 - age in weeks)</dt>
			<dd>This is ensuring that you can make even payments between now and the terminal date.
				At 30 years old, you're dividing your account balance by a bit under 5000.
				At 60, you're diving your account balance by a bit more than 3000.
				The result is how much you can take out <em>each week</em>.</dd>

			<dt>(current account balance) * (0.01/52)</dt>
			<dd>Pretty much whatever investment you have for your account is going to return more than 1% a year.
				Therefore, it's safe to withdraw 1/52nd of 1% of the account each week, and your account will still
				grow overall, so you should be able to take these payments indefintely.</dd>

		</dl>

		<p>The second way to control withdrawls is by defining eligibility criteria. These are to be managed by the financial
		institution holding the account, which is audited for compliance by the SSA. Here are the eligibility criteria:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Taxable income in the previous full quarter was less than 25% the federal poverty line.</li>
			<li>Taxable income in the preivous two full quarters was less than 50% of the previous' year taxable income.</li>
			<li>Enrollment in a certificate or degree program in accredited vocational school,
				professional school, college, or university, or graduation from one of these programs within the last
				year.</li>
			<li>One or more of the following within the last six months: wedding, divorce, declaration of
				bankruptcy, purchase or sale of a primary residence.</li>
			<li>Death of a dependent, spouse, child, or parent within the last three months.</li>
			<li>Birth or adoption of a child within the last three years.</li>
			<li>Change of residence of more than 100 miles within the last three months.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>So these handle cases of disabled individuals who cannot work, people who are (or should be) out of the
		workforce for some reason or another, or the classic moments of life hardship. These criteria aren't too
		hard to meet, but you have to prove they occurred and provide auditable evidence of that to the institution
		that holds the account. That slight hurdle is the extent of the discouragement: otherwise, it's up to you
		to be reasonable with when you withdraw from your account, keeping in mind that the only person you're hurting
		is your own retirement.</p>

		<p>Also, since we do not want a market downturn to hurt those who are already suffering, we need to institute a
		rule: while you are withdrawing from your account and for one year afterwards, new investments and re-investments
		must be made into T-Bills. This includes maturing bonds, dividends, and sharedown contributions. All that goes
		into T-Bills. It is hurting the long-term profitability of your account, but someone in that position is too
		financially fragile to be able to weather ups and downs. If you don't like that, don't withdraw. If you have
		no choice but to withdraw, then you're one of those fragile people.

		</p><h4 id="universal-base-income">Can I Just Decide Not Work and Live Off the Balance in My Account?</h4>

		<p>Sure. If you have enough money in your account to live a reasonable lifestyle, then go for it.</p>

		<p>Create some art, start a business, make a living crafting, take some time to garden or
		raise your kids. Enjoy.</p>

		<h4>Wait, Did You Just Sneak Universal Basic Income into Social Security Privatization?</h4>

		<p>Ssssh. Don't tell anyone!</p>

		<p>(I mean, not really, but it's about 80% of Universal Basic Income without putting any burden on
		the state to fund it, so close enough.)</p>

		<h3 id="fiddling-details">Fiddling Details</h3>

		<p>Here are some fiddling details for the financial wonks in the audience. They are in no particular order.</p>

		<!--
		<p class="lead">If you don't care about policy details, jump to
		<a href="#scandalous-suggestions">the scandalous suggestions below</a>.</p>
		-->

		<ul>
			<li>Once you are eligible to make a withdrawl of a certain amount, you can withdraw that amount at any point in the future.
				Eligibility is not a "use it or lose it" benefit, and therefore there is also value in being retroactively eligible or
				"storing up" eligibility for later on.</li>
			<li>Eligibility does not "stack": you can't make larger, multiple, or additional withdrawls if you satisfy multiple
				eligibility criteria.</li>
			<li>When someone dies, the assets in their account may be transfered into beneficiaries' accounts as directed by will or
				probate. If the account escheats to the estate, it is escheated into the sharedown pool at the 100th percentile.</li>
			<li>The minimum amount required to invest freely is automatically inflation-adjusted each year. It just starts at $100k.</li>
			<li>Similarly, the threshold for when we start sharing down is automatically inflation-adjusted each year. It just starts
				at $35k.</li>
			<li>The SSA is responsible for authorizing private institutions to manage accounts.  Failure for an individual to comply
				comply will have their account reclaimed by the SSA and that individual will forfeit the ability to transfer it
				back out. Financial institutions that continuously fail to keep their accounts compliant will lose the ability to manage
				Individual Security Accounts accounts. </li>
			<li>I obviously conflated T-Bills, T-Notes, and T-Bonds throughout this document, but I am actually going to blur the lines
				farther. When I say that the account is invested in T-Bonds, I really meant that the account is investing in a pool with
				yields no less than T-Bonds with no more risk than T-Bond offerings. This means that a bank (or the Social Security
				Administration) can pool cash in order to make more advantageous bids for T-Bonds, or to buy longer term T-Bonds, as long
				as they will have the cash on hand to pay out when the balances mature. This opens up an opportunity for profit for those
				who are managing accounts and stabilizes the market somewhat, while still providing the stability and yield that the
				account-holder expects.</li>
			<li>Sharedowns are paid out at the end of the fourth quarter after they are collected. In the meantime, that money is pooled
				and invested in T-Bills. This gives time for the SSA to settle up accounts, rectify issues, etc., and also provides the
				SSA somewhere between one year and fifteen months of interest to offset operational costs.</li>
			<li>Operational costs for the SSA are paid out of the general fund, but are offset by the money generated by the SSA
				investment pool and sharedown pool.</li>
			<li>The goal with the modifiers is to make the income reported on a tax form into a "household income",
				with a slight nudge in support of those who need some more social support: namely, those with dependents.
				The baseline is a couple who is <strong>Married, Filing Jointly, with Dependents</strong>, whose income
				is multiplied by <strong>1 (ie: not adjusted)</strong>. Single parents or caretakers,
				denoted as those who are <strong>Unmarried with Dependents</strong>, also have a <strong>1</strong>
				multiplier, which gives them a significant advantage in the sharedown they get. Those who are
				<strong>Unmarried without Dependents</strong> or <strong>Married, Filing Separately, with Dependents</strong>
				have their income multiplied by <strong>2</strong>, in order to bring their benefits into alignment with
				a "household income". Finally, you have those who are <strong>Married, Filing Separetly, without
				Dependents</strong>. We want to discourage this category&mdash;it suspiciously looks like a tax
				dodge&mdash;and given that they have no dependents, we are less concerned about providing social support,
				so we multiply their income by <strong>2.5</strong>.</li>
