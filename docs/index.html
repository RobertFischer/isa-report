		<h1 id="paying-attention">This All Started When I Was Barely Paying Attention</h1>

		<p class="lead">
		Once upon a time, I was at a big dinner put on by my financial advisor's firm. Everyone they worked with was invited,
		and they had someone from American Funds come in to pitch us. I don't remember
		much about who that person was or what was said, but I remember this chart.</p>

		<blockquote class="twitter-tweet mx-auto" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Investing in index funds? See how 5 U.S.-focused American Funds have fared better since index funds launched. <a href="https://t.co/pyrx0M3wAI">https://t.co/pyrx0M3wAI</a></p>&mdash; American FundsÂ® (@AmericanFunds) <a href="https://twitter.com/AmericanFunds/status/860888140864552960?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 6, 2017</a></blockquote>

		<p>Of course, I was supposed to be taking from it that American Funds are awesome. And they certainly did well here, and the chart makes
		their point well. But what really got me is this: you put $10k in an investment&mdash;even a boring, bad long-term investment like an
		index fund&mdash;and you can turn it into a 70x return.  The American Mutual Fund, which is based on preservation of
		principal, still beat that and got you an 87x return. If you stuck with a mutual fund that targeted exclusively growth
		(<abbr class="initialism">AMCAP</abbr>),
		you saw a 200x return (you also saw some terrifying dips, but it paid off in the end). Those are some big multipliers, despite
		wading through some pretty ugly times.	So how did these numbers get so big?</p>

		<p>The real power of this wasn't the financial products themselves. That's not how you win. The financial products just determine
		how <em>much</em> you win. You win with the time-value of money: the combination of $10k and 40 years is the winning combination.
		Money through time allows you to tap the power of compound earnings. <strong>Money over time is exponential.</strong></p>

		<p>If you need to see that in practice, check the chart again: the funds that did the best were the ones that
		gained the most on the upswings. Even though they suffered worse on the downticks, they still were ahead...and when the next
		upswing happened, they had a head start which allowed them to pull even farther ahead. The more conservative funds couldn't
		catch up, and so they had to settle for mere 70x returns instead of 200x returns.</p>

		<h1 id="regret">My Immediate Regret</h1>

		<p class="lead">"Wow," I thought to myself,
		<strong>"I wish I had been forced put $10k away when I had 40 years before my retirement."</strong>
		I wasn't making very much at that point: I was working data entry for a sketchy and semi-predatory car loan place, so it
		didn't pay much, but I was living with my folks and eating their food and begging for gas money off them. I could have
		stashed away $10k over the course of a couple of years. If I had done that, simply by hiding that money away and ignoring it,
		I could be retiring with a lot of cash on hand no matter what else happened in the meantime. That'd be nice.</p>

		<p>I was thinking about this and about how youth is wasted on the young, and that's the point when I realized:
		I <em>was</em> forced to put money away before retirement. Specifically, that big
		<abbr class="initialism">FICA</abbr> bite that came out of every paycheck added up to $10k pretty fast. If you make
		$40k/year, you're contributing $10k in FICA every 4 years. If you make $20k/year (roughly $10/hr), you're contributing
		$10k in <abbr class="initialism">FICA</abbr> every 8 years. <b>If you put in 4 years at $40k or 8 years at $20k
		before your 30th birthday, you have putting enough into social security to have earned $2,000,000 in the bank when you
		retire at 70.</b> And that's if you never made another penny for your entire life. Two million.</p>

		<h2 id="contribution-chart">We Value Your Contributions</h2>

		<p class="lead">So just how much are you putting into social security? The tax that goes to social security is called
		<abbr class="initialism" title="Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance">OASDI</abbr>, and
		<a href="https://www.ssa.gov/oact/progdata/taxRates.html">the Social Security Administration has historical rates</a>.
		The short answer is that since 1990, 6.2% of your paycheck is taxed for social security. We'll start our calculation from
		1990 simplicity's sake. Given that number and some ballpark values about income history, here's how much you've contributed,
		and how much your social security contributions would be worth if you invested them in 30-Year T-Bills (the safest investment
		possible&mdash;basically, how much the money is worth to the government), high-yield bonds (a riskier but more profitable
		investment), and <a href="https://www.daveramsey.com/blog/the-12-reality">the 12% return rule</a>.</p>

		<p>Maybe you have been doing a better job than me saving for retirement, but my retirement funds
		aren't anything like the value of the money that I have contributed to the social security fund.
		Seeing those value curves going up makes me really wish that I had that kind of money at my disposal.
		But, the government's got that money, and they'll give me money when I get to my retirement age.
		So maybe I'm not missing out...? At this point, I went looking for what my social security payout
		can expect to be.</p>

		<h2 id="social-security-payout">The Payout</h2>

		<p>Right up front, let me say that I am ignoring the ugliness. As of this writing, the Social Security
		Trust Fund (which pays the social security benefits) is in a bad way, because Baby Boomers are drawing
		from it
		much faster than Millenials are refilling it. This was a predictable problem, and the trust fund had
		stashed away some surplus, but it is looking like we did not stash away enough: since 2010, we've been
		draining the account; in 2022, overall cost is expected to exceed total income for the fund; in 2034, the
		fund is completely depleted.
		(<a href="https://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TRSUM/index.html">See the Trustee's Report Summary, search for
			"Key Dates for the Trust Funds".</a>) The worst part is that it's not like we are being caught
		off-guard&mdash;every year since 1990, the Trustee's Report has predicted the fund being depleted
		between 2029 and 2043. (See
		<a href="https://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/2017/VI_B_LRact_bal.html#103557">Table VI.B1</a>.)
		Once the fund is depleted, Social Security is expected to only be able to pay 70% of its
		obligations.</p>

		<p>But let's ignore that. Let's pretend that social security is bailed out by the general fund, or some
		other miracle occurs, and that social security benefits for people retiring in the future remain
		consistent with what they are now. What would today's workers expect to receive?</p>

		<p class="lead">
		There's a lot of complexity in calculating exactly what your benefits are, having to do with the amount
		of your income, your years working, your family situation, and your retirement age. However, there is one
		simple constant that cuts through all of this: the maximum benefit. <strong>You will not receive more than
		$2,150/mo from Social Security retirement. Period. Full stop.</strong> So if you are banking on Social
		Security, you are maxing out your retirement lifestyle at $25k/year, and you are only going to get that if
		you made $128k or more for a decade or so.	(Oh, and did I mention the money you get back is taxable as
		income?)
		</p>

		<p>At this point, let's take a look at our chart again. Let's extrapolate out using average returns on
		investments and our pattern of raises, and see what kind of retirement that implies for us. We'll figure
		that we work for 40 years and drop all our social security contributions into 12% Rule investments. Then
		we will retire for 60 years without making another penny. Since we don't want a stock exchange collapse or
		a recession to ruin our retirmeent, we'll move all our investments into Treasury Bills (T-Bills): T-Bills
		are both safer and have a slightly better return on investment than storing the cash under our bed.
		During our retirement, we'll take half our interest and cash it out, and we'll save the other half, and
		we'll withdraw our principal evenly. This is all extremely conservative. How does
		that compare to Social Security's maximum payout?</p>

		<p>Behold the power of compound interest! You will probably end up dying with money in
		the bank, earning nontrivial amounts of interest. This is an account that you can leave
		to your children. It's intergenerational wealth, which is a stark contrast to the way
		social security works: if you die after 62 or with adult children, the contributions
		just vanish. There's no more value to you or your children. It's just a tax you paid
		and now the money's gone.</p>

		<p class="lead">All of this makes a pretty compelling case that, at least when it comes to ensuring
		a comfortable retirement for our citizens, the existing Social Security system should be
		replaced with an investment account.	It's just hard to argue with the numbers
		and the power of compound interest.</p>


		<h1 id="is-that-the-point">What's The Point?</h1>

		<p>Okay, so our existing Social Security structure is a really bad investment
		vehicle, and we (and our children) would be much better off if we took that
		money and invested it responsibly ourselves. "But," Clever
		Interlocutor says, "That's not the point! It's effectively a socialized insurance
		policy for death and disability, along with old age. When one of those things happens,
		Social Security ensures that you aren't entirely destitute." This is a totally fair
		point, Clever Interlocutor. Thanks for bringing it up.</p>

		<p class="lead">I would be a poor Christian indeed if I wanted to
		take away support from widows and orphans. But this is where you need to know an
		important truth, which every employer is acutely aware of but which many employees
		don't know: the <abbr class="initialism">FICA</abbr> payments you see coming out of
		your paycheck are literally only half the story. The government also taxes your
		employer at 6.2% of your income. This is beyond the 6.2% they already required your
		employer to take out of your paycheck, for a total of 12.4%.</p>

		<p>So this means that there's a second pool of time-value: the first is the time-value
		of your contributions, amounting to 6.2% of your income; the second is a matching pool
		with just as much value contributed by your employer. This means that literally every
		worker could have a matching non-worker who they supported. That person could have an
		identical retirement even though they never worked a day in their life. It would be
		entirely possible for Social Security to just pair people up at birth, one from a low
		socioeconomic setting and one from a high socioeconomic setting, and then have the
		two of them have the exact same benefits throughout their life. It'd be like
		<em>The Prince and the Pauper, Retirement Edition</em>. Although that is an interesting
		concept for a story, it's a pretty ham-fisted way to go about things. For the moment,
		it suffices to note that there is a pool of money available to address these issues
		which is equal in value to the pool of money that people have generated for their own
		retirement.</p>

		<h2 id="do-not-get-greedy">Don't Get Greedy</h2>

		<p>"I will let that slide for the moment," Clever Interlocutor interjects, "But caring
		for others is only part of the issue. People routinely lose their financial security when
		economic crashes happen, such as the Enron implosion or the Great Recession in the 2000s.
		Even when we are talking about the individual, Social Security provides a kind of guarantee
		of a baseline income in retirement, which stock investment portfolios simply cannot do."</p>

		<p>Again, you're right, Clever Interlocutor. So there are some important caveats that we need
		to note. A total stock market collapse would indeed
		wipe out a lot of financial products, including high-yield bond and stock investments. There
		are a whole world of even riskier investments that people are often sold, and there is the
		unfortunate fact that investors&mdash;especially amateurs who consider themselves
		well-informed&mdash;tend to think they are leading trends when really they are following them,
		which is a very risky and expensive behavior for an investor.
		(The excellent book, <em>Nudge</em>, covers this is detail.)</p>

		<p class="lead">The purpose of Social Security is not to make you rich in retirement or build
		intergenerational
		wealth. (Although it's awesome if it can do that, too.) The purpose of Social Security is to
		ensure that you are capable of retiring, and to do so without becoming destitute. So any kind of
		Social Security account would need to have a lot more constraints on it than a voluntary retirement
		account. We saw this in our scenario in the conservative behavior: withdrawing only a small amount
		of our principal at a time, reinvesting half our interest, and putting our money into T-Bills.
		Without those kind of regulations being in place, an individual account is not serving one of the
		key purposes that Social Security is there to serve.</p>

		<h3 id="prodigious-daughter">The Prodigious Daughter</h3>

		<p>In case the graphs above have not made the power of compound interest really obvious,
		let me tell you the Parable of the Prodigious Daughter. There was a family that had two twin children,
		a daughter and a son. The daughter scrimped and saved early on in her life and put away $15,000
		in 12% Rule investments. She then went to work with impoverished and homeless
		communities, which meant she didn't have any more money to save up. Her brother, on the other
		hand, began contributing to his retirement only after his sister did. He also didn't "go nuts"
		like she did, instead contributing $1000 a year for the next 39 years. He copied is sister's
		investments identically. When it came time to retire, he had contributed $39,000 and had
		almost $700,000 to retire on. Not too shabby! But she had only contributed $15,000&mdash;that's
		less than half of what he had contributed&mdash;yet retired with more than twice the cash her
		brother did. One year makes that much difference when compound interest is in play.</p>

		<p>This power of compound interest is the secret to the account-based Social Security alternative.
		It's why this approach will stay effectively solvent while the existing Social Security system is
		failing. This power, however, needs to be protected. There's going to be a tendency for people to
		want to get at their money. That's a reasonable desire, and I get it.  Yet for an account-based
		Social Security alternative to work, the
		first key regulation must protect the time-value of worker's contributions by preventing
		account-holders from withdrawing money
		too soon. They need to be like the daughter, not like the son, becuase the contributions alone
		aren't enough to provide for retirement. This isn't a hypothetical fact, this is a demonstrated
		fact: sacrificing the time-value of money is exactly the reason
		the current Social Security system has failed.</p>

		<p>The current Social Security system is based on the
		current workers paying taxes which directly pay for the benefits to retirees, based on the promise
		that when the current workers retire, the new breed of current worker will support them. But this
		system only works if the workforce and its income keeps growing faster than the people dependent
		upon it. The problems with this approach are identical to a
		<a href="http://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/ponzischeme.asp">Ponzi Scheme</a>, which is not an
		accident. An account-based Social Security alternative avoids the existing Ponzi scheme problems,
		but it can only work if workers are forced to leave their money in the accounts. Otherwise, the
		power of compound interest is lost, we are dependent on the contributions alone, and that's just
		not going to work.</p>

		<p>(BTW, if anyone ever says that Social Security is a Ponzi Scheme, please correct them: Ponzi
		Schemes promise high rates of return.)</p>

		<h3 id="role-of-risk">The Role of Risk</h3>

		<p>So far, I've been assuming a lot about return on investments for the sake of simplicity. But
		there is a nasty devil in the details, and it has to do with risk. It's an assumed truth that
		the stock market will always go up given a long enough period of time, and
		<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/06/27/what-warren-buffett-learned-from-buying-his-first-stock-at-age-11.html">that
		assumed truth is the key to Warren Buffett's wealth</a> (among others), so it seems safe for us to
		depend on it. Given enough time, you'll always win if you play the markets broadly.
		The problem is what happens when you run out of time.</p>

		<p>Between October 9th, 2007, and March 9th, 2009, the NASDAQ, S&amp;P 500, and Dow Jones all lost
		55% or more of their value
		(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_bear_market_of_2007%E2%80%9309#Index_levels">cite</a>).
		Given that the stock market does always go up given enough time, this translates into a firesale for
		those with time to wait, but does that lost value hamstring their ability to grow? And how does this
		impact people without time to grow? This sounds like we need another chart.</p>

		<p>In the following chart, we have two people who make the same amount of money (the median US income, $40k),
		and they have both put all their money into the market at 12% Return Rule investments, but they get hit with
		a 55% market downturn at some point in their 40 year contributing career. The chart below shows how being
		hit at different times (or not at all) impacts the money available at the end of the career.</p>

		<p>Taking a major hit from a market downturn is clearly painful no matter when it happens, but
		it is especially painful as you get closer to retirement: the amazing power of compound interest
		is foiled by a huge market downturn without time for the compound interest build up again. Good
		mutual funds&mdash;especially those that emphasize "preservation of principal"&mdash;already
		understand how to protect against market downturns, and they do so by using government bonds
		(and other low-risk bonds) as a hedge. We actually already used this approach (in an extreme way)
		in our retirement calculator: we shifted all our investments into Treasury Bills at retirement.
		A Treasury Bill (aka: T-Bill) is basically a contract with the US Treasury where you give them
		your money for a certain number of years, and they give you a percentage return on that interest.</p>

		<p>It would take the effective collapse of the US government for T-Bills to lose
		their value, so they are the ultimate insurance policy for US investors. They are also the lowest
		possible risk investment, and therefore the lowest possible return investment. Although you do
		make some interest off T-Bills, you are missing out on the potential of making a lot more.
		But if the purpose of Social Security is to ensure that people are able to retire and not be
		destitute, then T-Bills are exactly a product we can use to get there, and the accounts should
		be required to carry an appropriate amount of T-Bills as investments to mitigate risk, even if
		that limits our returns. That's the cost of security.</p>

		<p>The conventional wisdom is that you should have some multiple of your age in bonds, with that
		multiple being somewhere between 0.5 and 2.5. The higher that multiple, the more you carry in bonds,
		and the less overall return you would expect to see in the long run. However, the higher that
		multiple, the more you carry in bonds, and the less you will expect to lose in short-term market
		downturns.</p>

		<p>To see this balancing act in action, let's take a look at Alice and Bob again, but this time
		assuming they start work at 20 years old, retire at 60 years old, carry T-Bills equal to their
		age in percent. Since they hit their market downturns at different ages, the impact of this
		insurance will be be markedly different on their account balance.</p>

		<p>Well, I'll be a monkey's uncle. It never works to your advantage to carry insurance with a
		55% market downturn. The crash of 1929 (the one that started the Great Depression) was a 82% downturn
		(<a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/historys-worst-bear-markets-2014-7">cite</a>). So let's take
		a look at that.</p>

		<p>Even in this worst-case-in-history example, people hit early on in their investment
		careers are better off without the insurance that bonds provide. The bonds outright hurt
		you until you are well over halfway through your investment career, and they don't
		really help you until you get to the last 5 to 10 years. Even then, the help isn't very
		significant: it protects about 20% of your principal in the case of a second Great
		Depression hitting. As we saw above, anything less was pure downside with no upside.</p>

		<p>Now, these models aren't realistic: they treat the hit as a one-time thing, and
		immediately resume 12% Rule levels of returns. Truly severe economic downturns take
		years to recover and don't have those levels of return in the meantime. However, they
		make the point that the damage done by low returns is worse than the damage done by
		economic downturns, assuming you have time to wait out the downturn.</p>

		<p>It's also important to remember that some people have zero time to wait: those who
		are in retirement cannot afford a 55% or 82% loss on their principal, because they
		are living off of it. So T-Bills are the perfect investment vehicle for those folks,
		because preservation of principal&mdash;that is, not losing any money&mdash;is the
		most important thing.</p>
