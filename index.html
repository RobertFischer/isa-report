    <h1 id="paying-attention">This All Started When I Was Barely Paying Attention</h1>

    <p class="lead">
    Once upon a time, I was at a big dinner put on by my financial advisor's firm. Everyone they worked with was invited,
    and they had someone from American Funds come in to pitch us. I don't remember
    much about who that person was or what was said, but I remember this chart.</p>

    <blockquote class="twitter-tweet mx-auto" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Investing in index funds? See how 5 U.S.-focused American Funds have fared better since index funds launched. <a href="https://t.co/pyrx0M3wAI">https://t.co/pyrx0M3wAI</a></p>&mdash; American FundsÂ® (@AmericanFunds) <a href="https://twitter.com/AmericanFunds/status/860888140864552960?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 6, 2017</a></blockquote>

    <p>Of course, I was supposed to be taking from it that American Funds are awesome. And they certainly did well here, and the chart makes
    their point well. But what really got me is this: you put $10k in an investment&mdash;even a boring, bad long-term investment like an
    index fund&mdash;and you can turn it into a 70x return.  The American Mutual Fund, which is based on preservation of
    principal, still beat that and got you an 87x return. If you stuck with a mutual fund that targeted exclusively growth
    (<abbr class="initialism">AMCAP</abbr>),
    you saw a 200x return (you also saw some terrifying dips, but it paid off in the end). Those are some big multipliers, despite
    wading through some pretty ugly times.  So how did these numbers get so big?</p>

    <p>The real power of this wasn't the financial products themselves. That's not how you win. The financial products just determine
    how <em>much</em> you win. You win with the time-value of money: the combination of $10k and 40 years is the winning combination.
    Money through time allows you to tap the power of compound earnings. <strong>Money over time is exponential.</strong></p>

    <p>If you need to see that in practice, check the chart again: the funds that did the best were the ones that
    gained the most on the upswings. Even though they suffered worse on the downticks, they still were ahead...and when the next
    upswing happened, they had a head start which allowed them to pull even farther ahead. The more conservative funds couldn't
    catch up, and so they had to settle for mere 70x returns instead of 200x returns.</p>

    <h1 id="regret">My Immediate Regret</h1>

    <p class="lead">"Wow," I thought to myself,
    <strong>"I wish I had been forced put $10k away when I had 40 years before my retirement."</strong>
    I wasn't making very much at that point: I was working data entry for a sketchy and semi-predatory car loan place, so it
    didn't pay much, but I was living with my folks and eating their food and begging for gas money off them. I could have
    stashed away $10k over the course of a couple of years. If I had done that, simply by hiding that money away and ignoring it,
    I could be retiring with a lot of cash on hand no matter what else happened in the meantime. That'd be nice.</p>

    <p>I was thinking about this and about how youth is wasted on the young, and that's the point when I realized:
    I <em>was</em> forced to put money away before retirement. Specifically, that big
    <abbr class="initialism">FICA</abbr> bite that came out of every paycheck added up to $10k pretty fast. If you make
    $40k/year, you're contributing $10k in FICA every 4 years. If you make $20k/year (roughly $10/hr), you're contributing
    $10k in <abbr class="initialism">FICA</abbr> every 8 years. <b>If you put in 4 years at $40k or 8 years at $20k
    before your 30th birthday, you have putting enough into social security to have earned $2,000,000 in the bank when you
    retire at 70.</b> And that's if you never made another penny for your entire life. Two million.</p>

    <h2 id="contribution-chart">We Value Your Contributions</h2>

    <p class="lead">So just how much are you putting into social security? The tax that goes to social security is called
    <abbr class="initialism" title="Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance">OASDI</abbr>, and
    <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/oact/progdata/taxRates.html">the Social Security Administration has historical rates</a>.
    The short answer is that since 1990, 6.2% of your paycheck is taxed for social security. We'll start our calculation from
    1990 simplicity's sake. Given that number and some ballpark values about income history, here's how much you've contributed,
    and how much your social security contributions would be worth if you invested them in 30-Year T-Bills (the safest investment
    possible&mdash;basically, how much the money is worth to the government), high-yield bonds (a riskier but more profitable
    investment), and <a href="https://www.daveramsey.com/blog/the-12-reality">the 12% return rule</a>.</p>

    <p>Maybe you have been doing a better job than me saving for retirement, but my retirement funds
    aren't anything like the value of the money that I have contributed to the social security fund.
    Seeing those value curves going up makes me really wish that I had that kind of money at my disposal.
    But, the government's got that money, and they'll give me money when I get to my retirement age.
    So maybe I'm not missing out...? At this point, I went looking for what my social security payout
    can expect to be.</p>

    <h2 id="social-security-payout">The Payout</h2>

    <p>Right up front, let me say that I am ignoring the ugliness. As of this writing, the Social Security
    Trust Fund (which pays the social security benefits) is in a bad way, because Baby Boomers are drawing
    from it
    much faster than Millenials are refilling it. This was a predictable problem, and the trust fund had
    stashed away some surplus, but it is looking like we did not stash away enough: since 2010, we've been
    draining the account; in 2022, overall cost is expected to exceed total income for the fund; in 2034, the
    fund is completely depleted.
    (<a href="https://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TRSUM/index.html">See the Trustee's Report Summary, search for
      "Key Dates for the Trust Funds".</a>) The worst part is that it's not like we are being caught
    off-guard&mdash;every year since 1990, the Trustee's Report has predicted the fund being depleted
    between 2029 and 2043. (See
    <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/2017/VI_B_LRact_bal.html#103557">Table VI.B1</a>.)
    Once the fund is depleted, Social Security is expected to only be able to pay 70% of its
    obligations.</p>

    <p>But let's ignore that. Let's pretend that social security is bailed out by the general fund, or some
    other miracle occurs, and that social security benefits for people retiring in the future remain
    consistent with what they are now. What would today's workers expect to receive?</p>

    <p class="lead">
    There's a lot of complexity in calculating exactly what your benefits are, having to do with the amount
    of your income, your years working, your family situation, and your retirement age. However, there is one
    simple constant that cuts through all of this: the maximum benefit. <strong>You will not receive more than
    $2,155/mo from Social Security retirement. Period. Full stop.</strong> So if you are banking on Social
    Security, you are maxing out your retirement lifestyle at $25k/year. (Oh, and did I mention it's taxable as
    income?)
    </p>

    <p>At this point, let's take a look at our chart again. Let's extrapolate out using average returns on
    investments and our pattern of raises, and see what kind of retirement that implies for us. We'll figure
    that we work for 40 years and drop all our social security contributions into high-yield bonds. Then
    we will retire for 60 years without making another penny.
    During retirement, we'll take half our interest and cash it out, and we'll save the other half, and
    we'll withdraw our principal evenly. This is all extremely conservative. How does
    that compare to Social Security's maximum payout?</p>

    <p>Behold the power of compound interest! You will probably end up dying with money in
    the bank, earning nontrivial amounts of interest. This is an account that you can leave
    to your children. It's intergenerational wealth, which is a stark contrast to the way
    social security works: if you die after 62 or with adult children, the contributions
    just vanish. There's no more value to you or your children. It's just a tax.</p>
